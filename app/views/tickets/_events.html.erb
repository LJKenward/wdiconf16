          Before settling in for two days of conference action, <span class="bolded">Envato</span> would like to treat all attendees to a breakfast feast. Our keynote speakers will probably be hanging by the doughnuts table if you want to chat, otherwise you'll be able to meet the other conference go-ers.

            For those starting out in the software development world, contributing to open source projects can feel pretty out of reach and intimidating. Your inner monologue might sound something like, 'what if people laugh at my PR's?' or 'how do I even start to understand such a large codebase?'. Pranati will be addressing some fundamental questions on how the open source world works, and how you can actually enhance your learning journey by reading and contributing to open source projects.
